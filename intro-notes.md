# MERN Stack

_The MERN stack consisits of the following technologies:_

- **MongoDB**: A Document-based open source database.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **React**: A javascript front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).

and **Mongoose**: Simple, schema-based solution to model application data.

### Example of a MongoDB enrty

##### BSON Types

```
{
  name: "John Smith",
  title: "Teacher",
  address: {
                  address 1: "3 Some Street",
                  city: "Paris",
                  post_code: "P21 3RB"
              },
  subjects: ["P.E", "Geography"],
  Employee number: 12234,
  location: [432.321, 432.123]
}
```

_Same as the JavaScript object syntax._
